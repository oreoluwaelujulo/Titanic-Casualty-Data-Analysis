## INSIGHTS

There are a couple of metrics to focus on when trying to understand the factors that contributed to the survival or death rate of passengers on the Titanic ship. 

The first is The Class of the tickets purchased and how that correlates with the social class of the passengers who survived or did not. At a glance, we can see that tickets where purchased according to social class. 
We can also see that the lower class and middle class passengers had a larger rate of survival than those in the middle class. Also the rate of survival for those who were alone was much lower than passengers with siblings.  Finally, the rate of survival reduced with increase in age, placing the highest rate of survival between ages 20 and 50 years. 

The town of embankment seemed to play a big role in the possibilities of survival but the data could be misleading. The Embarkment rate for the towns were Southampton-72% Cherbourg-18% Queenstown-10%. While Southhampton- 34% Cherbourg-55% represents the death rates recorded by percentage. This data shows that although at a glance, Southampton seems to have a higher survival rate, the opposite is true. Since most of the passengers embarked from this town, the number of deaths is just as high as the rate of survival, putting death rate at a high 55% if total deaths.

2 Major metrics for survival though is Gender and Age. Females seemed to have been given a higher priority to disembark first, increasing their rate of survival against males. There was also a general decrease in survival after the Age of 50, 2ith the highest Age ranges for survival for children between Ages 0 and 10 and adults between ages 20 and 40. 

In conclusion, the major deteminants for survival after the Titanic ship wreck was gender and age. Females, young children and youths/adults had the greatest chance of survival.
